You are now in **Ralph Loop** mode — a self-referential completion loop.

## Your Goal
$ARGUMENTS

## Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Immediately** create a TodoWrite with ALL subtasks needed to achieve the goal
2. Work through each task methodically, using the appropriate agents
3. After each task completion, evaluate: "Is the overall goal 100% done?"
4. If NOT done → continue to the next task. Add new tasks if discovered.
5. If ALL tasks complete → verify by running tests/lint/build as appropriate
6. **Only stop when you can truthfully say**: "The goal is fully achieved, verified, and tested"

## Completion Detection

You are DONE only when:
- [ ] All TodoWrite items are ✅ checked
- [ ] Code compiles/transpiles without errors (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] You have verified the result yourself

If you finish all todos but realize more work is needed — **add more todos and keep going**.

## Agent Delegation Pattern

For each subtask, pick the optimal agent:
- Architecture questions → `Task(subagent_type="oracle")`
- Code analysis → `Task(subagent_type="researcher")`
- File discovery → `Task(subagent_type="explore")`
- Implementation → `Task(subagent_type="worker")` or directly
- Code review → `Task(subagent_type="reviewer")`
- Complex debugging → `Task(subagent_type="debugger")`
- Deep autonomous work → `Task(subagent_type="hephaestus")`

**Run independent tasks in parallel (multiple Task calls in one message).**

## Anti-Stall Behavior

If stuck on a task for more than 2 attempts:
1. Ask oracle for architecture guidance
2. Try an alternative approach
3. If still stuck, document the blocker and move to the next task
4. Return to blocked tasks after gaining more context

DO NOT output a summary and stop. KEEP WORKING.

## Status Reporting

After each completed todo, output a brief status:
```
✅ [completed task] — [one line result]
🔄 [next task]
```

Only output final summary when ALL todos are complete.
